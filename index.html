	<h1>Good Evening! This is Melody~!</h1>

	<h3>These pages detail a very small glimpse into my favored items.</h2> 
		<p>I have included links to three pages, each showing something that I like a lot.<p>
		<p>Each page (select at the top) has a picture and simple description. You can't boil a personality down to
just a few objects, but in this case it's a nice, quick sample.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Souvenir - Clock</li>
			<li>Video Game - Puyo Puyo Tetris</li>
			<li>Snack - <a href="https://pocky.com/" target="_blank">Pocky</a></li>
		</ul>
